# 3D-Physics-Parkour
This is a first-person 3D platformer game built with Python and the Ursina game engine. The player's goal is to use their physics gun and rocket jump ability to navigate between floating platforms and reach the end of the level.

Features
First-Person Controls: Includes W/A/S/D movement, mouse look, and jumping.

Physics Interaction: Use the physics gun to fire projectiles that can push specific orange blocks, using them to create paths or clear obstacles.

Rocket Jump: Press the right mouse button to fire a pulse downwards, enabling higher and farther jumps, a key skill for advanced movement.

Level Design: Features a fixed level composed of multiple platforms, challenging the player's parkour and puzzle-solving skills.

Health and Respawn: Players have 3 health points. Falling off a platform deducts health and sends the player back to the starting point.

Block Reset Mechanism: Each area is equipped with a console. If a block is accidentally dropped, the player can press a button to respawn it.

Complete Game Loop: Features clear win conditions (reaching the goal), loss conditions (health at 0), and a replay mechanism after victory.
